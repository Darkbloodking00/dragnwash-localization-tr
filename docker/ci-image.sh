# The image a CI job runs its check in: pulled when this repository's machines
# run, built from docker/Dockerfile when they cannot reach the package.
#
# A pull request from a fork gets a read-only token that cannot read a private
# package, and a fork has no package of its own. Building takes a minute or two
# there and the result is the same image, from the same Dockerfile, so a
# contributor's pull request is checked exactly as a maintainer's is - no
# secret, no permission, nothing to ask for.
#
# Prints the tag to run. Used by the workflows:
#
#   IMAGE=$(docker/ci-image.sh)
#   docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work "$IMAGE" docker/checks.sh
